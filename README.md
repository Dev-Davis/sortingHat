# sortingHat  

We are making a project where we can sort by the click of a button, assign students to a random house with appearance of thew students name and sorting button. On sorting a student, the form should clear and a bootstrap card with the student's name and house should print below the form. You should also be able to expel a student after they have been sorted, which should remove their card from the student record.
